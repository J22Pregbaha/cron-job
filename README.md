# Running a cron job on windows

> I recently learnt how to create a cron job on windows. For those who don't know (like I didn't until just a while ago) a cron job is a scheduled job that runs as often as you want it to without the need for you to trigger it.

You can get a detailed description of how to do it [here](https://medium.com/@shraddha_kulkarni/run-php-cron-in-windows-513fb1aa53a5).
